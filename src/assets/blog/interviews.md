## Introduction

Interviews (and recruiting season in general) can be super stressful. My goal with this guide is to give you some strategies to deal with common behavioral/technical patterns in software engineering interviews.

## The STAR Method: Structuring Your Behavioral Answers

Behavioral questions often start with, "Tell me about a time when..." Use the **STAR Method** to deliver clear and concise answers:

- **Situation**: Set the stage and provide context.
- **Task**: Explain the challenge or goal.
- **Action**: Detail the steps you took to address the problem.
- **Result**: Share the outcome and why it was effective.

### Common Behavioral Scenarios

#### Managing Conflict

**Example**: Disagreeing with a colleague on a technical decision.

- Empathize with their perspective and ask clarifying questions.
- Use data to support your rationale.
- Accept the resolution and focus on moving forward.

#### Handling Large or Ambiguous Projects

**Example**: Leading a project with undefined goals.

- Clarify requirements and gather data.
- Narrow the scope and find compromises.
- Communicate consistently with your team and create a short- and long-term plan.

#### Managing Priorities and Deadlines

**Example**: Delivering an incomplete feature for a high-stakes presentation.

- Understand and align priorities with team goals.
- Compromise and focus on what matters most.
- Take accountability for decisions and outcomes.

#### Dealing with Feedback

**Example**: Receiving constructive criticism during a project.

- Be open and listen to feedback carefully.
- Acknowledge mistakes and commit to improvement.
- Implement changes to enhance future outcomes.

#### Convincing Others

**Example**: Choosing between two competing technical solutions.

- Present a data-driven argument and consider opposing views.
- Compromise when necessary but stand firm on critical points.

#### Handling Mistakes

**Example**: Pushing a broken feature to production.

- Identify and fix the issue quickly.
- Inform the team and take ownership of the mistake.
- Implement safeguards like automated testing to prevent future problems.

## Technical Interviews: Strategies for Success

### Technical Interviews: Strategies for Success

#### Leetcode Style Problems

1. **Read and Understand**:

   - Read the entire question carefully
   - Note key requirements and constraints
   - Identify input/output formats

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:

   - Confirm input ranges and types
   - Discuss edge cases
   - Verify expected output format

3. **Plan Your Approach**:

   - Think through possible solutions
   - Explain your strategy to interviewer
   - Get confirmation before coding

4. **Implementation**:

   - Write clean, readable code
   - Explain your logic line by line
   - Use meaningful variable names

5. **Test Your Solution**:

   - Start with simple test cases
   - Consider edge cases
   - Walk through code execution

6. **Debug and Optimize**:

   - Fix any issues found
   - Run all test cases
   - Look for optimization opportunities

7. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Explain time complexity (Big O)
   - Discuss space complexity
   - Consider possible trade-offs

### System Design

1. **Requirements**:

   - Functional: What should the system do?
   - Non-functional: Performance, scalability, and reliability.
   - Traffic: Expected requests per second, storage, and bandwidth.

2. **Estimations**:

   - Estimate System traffic in terms of requirements (req/s,data storage,bandwith)
   - Work in bytes for clarity.
   - Example: 1 day = 86,400 seconds; 1 KB = 1,000 bytes.

3. **Design APIs**:

   - List key endpoints and their purposes.
   - Doesn’t have to be exhaustive just the most important ones

4. **High-Level Design**:

   - Lay out core components(load balancers,CDN,Cache,Database,Application)
   - Map data flow from request to response.

5. **Database Design**:

   - Discuss schema, indices, and sharding strategies.
   - Optimize for performance and requirements.

6. **Extensibility**:
   - Expand on Initial Design
   - Add scalability and fault tolerance.
   - Eliminate single points of failure and evaluate trade-offs.

### Questions to Ask the Interviewer

- In your experience, is there a culture of collaboration and mentorship?
- What projects have interns worked on in the past?
- Are there opportunities to grow and take on responsibilities?

## Quick Tips for Success

- Think aloud during technical questions.
- Be adaptable—unexpected challenges happen.
- Own your mistakes; focus on how you’ve learned and improved.
